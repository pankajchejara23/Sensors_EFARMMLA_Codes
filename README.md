# EFAR-MMLA: An Evaluation Framework for Assessing and Reporting ML Model Generalizablity in MMLA

This repository contains anlysis codes of case study presented in the EFAR-MMLA paper to illustrate the useful ness of proposed framework.

The anlaysis codes includes the following

* Developing ML models for estimating collaboration quality and its sub-dimensions.
* Assessing those ML models on different levels of generalizablity (e.g., instance, group, context).
* Generating graphs for results.
